Predicting ratings on critic reviews (LSTM and Naive Bayes)

Many critic reviews on concerts do not have ratings, only a descriptive text of the concert experience. This project classifies reviews into 1-5 stars, depending on the text of the review. Two models we're tested a Naive Bayes and an LSTM with word embeddings. The LSTM provided the best results with an accuracy of 62%. I created the dataset myself by mining reviews from The Guardian and NME with ratings on them and preprocesssed the dataset before applying machine learning.
