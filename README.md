Predicting ratings on critic reviews (LSTM and Naive Bayes)

Many critic reviews on concerts do not have ratings, only a descriptive text of the concert experience. This project predicts a rating based only on the text from the author. Two models we're tested a Naive Bayes and an LSTM with word embeddings. The LSTM provided the best results with an accuracy of 62%.
